			<!-- BLOG INTRO  -->
					
			<div class="row" id="intro">
				<p>The following blog mixes personal experiences and analysis about Dutch culture, and is an example of my writing skills. From the SEO perspective, I seek to rank among subjects related to life in Amsterdam and Dutch culture, while the target audience are expats living in the city or people abroad interested in knowing more about the Dutch culture.</p>

				<h1>The Dutch Health System Explained</h1>
				<h4>Posted: May 16th, 2017</h4>

				<p style="font-style:italic">As I always say, is the point of view of the observer what defines the way we understand reality; therefore, I will explain the Dutch heath system by pivoting between what I believe are the two most known models: on one end, a fully publicly owned system, where health is considered a collective right, and is funded by the state through regular taxes; on the other end, a fully private system, where health is considered an individual service, and each person needs to pay its costs individually.</p>

				<p>I would also like to disclose that I do believe in health care as a Human Right, as a collective effort we do in solidarity to contribute to our society. I do think health care is meant to be well administrated, though not meant to give earnings. I understand all systems need to have sufficient funds, which I believe should come mostly from income-based taxes.</p>

				<p>Let’s go further and try to summarize how the Dutch system works:</p>

				<ul id="listBlog">
						<li>It is a mix between public and private: the government invests using money collected through general taxes, while an extra contribution is required through an individual health insurance.</li>
						<li>Health insurance is compulsory and paid individually in both a monthly fee (premie) and a yearly cost called own risk (eigen risico).</li>
						<li>The margins of the yearly own risk is fixed by the government every year, a bit considering spending and a lot according to politics.</li>
						<li>This occurs on Prinsjesdag – 3rd Tuesday of September – when the King formally opens the Parliament sessions and announces the policies for the coming year.</li>
						<li>You don’t pay insurance to the state, but to private non-profit administrators/insurers.</li>
						<li>Administrators/insurers are obliged to offer you the basic insurance, but you can also choose extra services depending on what you think you might need (eg. dental plan).</li>
						<li>You can chose paying a higher yearly own risk and a lower monthly fee.</li>
						<li>When I arrived – 6 years ago – the minimum yearly own risk was around 200 euros, and it has now climbed to 385 euros, while the monthly fee has stayed almost the same.</li>
						<li>Example: on the lower end, you may decide having the minimum 385-euros yearly own risk and pay around 110 euros for the basic coverage per month per each adult; on the other end, you might want to set the maximum 885-euros own risk per year, paying around 90 euros per month. As you see, the monthly payment doesn’t change much.</li>
						<li>People with low incomes or unemployed, can be entitled to social welfare coverage for the monthly premie, while they might also have other benefits for the own risk.</li>
						<li>Basic coverage for children up to 18 years old is included in their parent’s insurance, including their basic dental coverage.</li>
						<li>For all insurances and options, the General Practitioner is always included at no extra cost.</li>
						<li>For all other treatments and specialities, you will pay the visit and treatment up to covering what you have decided is your own risk.</li>
						<li>The own risk can also be paid in monthly instalments – this is arranged with the insurer every time you receive a bill.</li>
						<li>In most cases, you go to the pharmacy with the prescription and insurance card and you get the bill by email or regular mail through the insurer, as part of your own risk.</li>
						<li>Changes in services (eg. reduced choice of hospitals) might weigh in the price of the monthly premie.</li>
						<li>Once you have the insurance, you need to find a General Practitioner – it is usually advised to chose someone in your area.</li>
						<li>My advice: the first year get a basic insurance with no extras – or maybe a small dental plan – and low own risk. After the first year you can evaluate how it works and decide better.</li>
				</ul>


				<p>Even though the system has outstanding statistics to show, the concept of health care for Dutch people has unavoidably become something you need to individually pay to have, a product, instead of a right every citizen is entitled to, based in the solidarity expressed through a – fair – tax system.</p>

				<p>Although people with economic problems has partial or total coverage through social welfare and/or tax returns, if you happen to be someone living illegally in the country and have a chronic disease, the hospital will take you in and treat you enough to allow you to walk away, but they will not treat you for the chronic condition.</p>

				<p>In my opinion, not even one single person should be left behind because they aren’t wealthy enough, particularly in a country that can afford the price.</p>
